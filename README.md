# geometric_modeling

Some course-related (Geometric Modeling) code. One of my favorite courses!

Here is a sample assignment: https://github.com/shubhomoydas/geometric_modeling/blob/master/results/assignment-results.pdf

This project depends on Visual Studio and OpenGL. The OpenGL libs and include files can be downloaded from the repository for the Computer Graphics course: https://github.com/shubhomoydas/computer_graphics
